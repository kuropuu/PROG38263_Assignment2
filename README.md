### Requirements
This web application requires:
* Python 3
* Django 2.0+
* django-crispy-forms

### Reset Password Function
We did not implement a SMTP server since this is only for development purposes. 
We sent the emails to a folder in the project's home directory called "emails." 
If you are trying to reset your password, simply type in the email address 
associated with your account and then open the corresponding file in the "emails" 
directory. Copy and paste the URL into your web browser to reset your password.
